# Composer Tutorial
A walk through of various Composer tasks.

[Composer](//getcomposer.org/) is a dependency manager for PHP.

Each step in this tutorial goes over basic Composer usage. The 
`composer.json` files in each directory should be usable, and each directory 
will have a README file explaining the concepts and commands for that step.

If you find any mistakes, please open an issue for create a pull request. Don't 
assume I know what I'm doing.&trade;

##Background
The steps in this tutorial are based on building a [Drupal 8](//drupal.org) project with
Composer, since that was the original motivation for the tutorial. However,
most of what is explained is specific to Composer, not Drupal, so the
information should still be relevant to any PHP project. And since the Drupal 8
use-case is more complex than simple "Hello, World!" functionality, it shows
some of Composer's possibilities.
